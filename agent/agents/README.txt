SUBAGENT PITFALLS
=================

The *.md files here are custom agent definitions. Every item below was observed on
this machine, not inferred from docs. Harness references: omp://task-agent-discovery.md,
omp://tools/task.md, omp://tools/hub.md

This file is .txt on purpose. See item 13.


1. No `spawns` key means the child holds a `task` tool that can never spawn anything
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With neither `tools` nor `spawns` in the frontmatter, the child session gets an empty
spawn policy while `task` stays in its tool list. Every call is then refused at
preflight:

    Cannot spawn 'mentor:default'. Allowed: none (spawns disabled for this agent)

A missing `spawns` only defaults to "*" when the `tools` list itself contains `task`
(backward-compat behaviour, omp://task-agent-discovery.md, "Agent definition shape").
Declare neither and you get a dead tool. Prompt wording cannot work around this.


2. Prefer an explicit allowlist over `spawns: "*"`
---------------------------------------------------
The two forms differ in what an omitted `agent` field resolves to:

    spawns: "*"        -> omitted `agent` resolves to the bundled `task`
    spawns: a, b, c    -> omitted `agent` resolves to the first listed name

The bundled `task` sits in `task.disabledAgents` in config.yml (along with `scout`,
`sonic`, `reviewer`, `security-reviewer`), so "*" plus an omitted field is a hard
preflight failure. An explicit list closes that trap for free — but choose the first
entry deliberately, because it is the silent default. The files here list
`task:mid` first.


3. Names in `task.disabledAgents` fail even when allowlisted
-------------------------------------------------------------
Currently disabled: task, scout, sonic, reviewer, security-reviewer. Listing one in
`spawns` does not revive it. Always name `agent` explicitly when dispatching; relying
on the default walks into item 2.


4. Recursion depth 2: grandchildren are leaves
-----------------------------------------------
`task.maxRecursionDepth` defaults to 2. A worker spawned by the main agent sits at
depth 1; that worker's own child sits at depth 2, which is the cap — its `task` tool
is *stripped* and its spawn policy cleared.

Consequence: a worker can fan out one level, but whatever it hands out must be
directly executable, never "decompose this further". A plan that needs three live
levels has to start one level shallower.

Observed: a `task:low` child of a `task:mid` worker reported its tool list
as read, bash, edit, eval, glob, grep, hub, web_search, write, yield — no `task`.


5. An agent whose only tool is `yield` will silently lose its answer
--------------------------------------------------------------------
`mentor-default.md` declares `tools: []`, so `yield` is its only tool. Observed failure chain:

    writes the full answer as plain prose, no tool call
      -> harness injects "Last turn had no tool call -> session idle"
      -> the forced follow-up `yield` carries nothing
      -> job ends `failed (exit 1)` + "Subagent called yield with null data."

This is real data loss, not cosmetics: `agent://<id>` did not contain the answer at
all. The parent only recovered the prose incidentally from a `hub` snapshot. The fix
is to state in the prompt that the opening answer must ride in the `yield` payload and
that a turn must never end with text only (see the Dialogue section of mentor-default.md).

Any agent trimmed down to `yield` alone carries this risk, not just mentors.


6. `agent://` and `history://` are not the same thing
------------------------------------------------------
    agent://<id>            the consumption channel; the `yield` payload lands here
    history://<id>          the full transcript, showing how it actually proceeded
    agent://<id>?q=.field   pull one field out of a structured result

A failed job can leave a perfectly good transcript behind an empty artifact (item 5).
When debugging a failed child, read `history://` first; job status alone misleads.


7. Job ids expire, agent ids do not
------------------------------------
Job rows are process-local and disappear roughly five minutes after settling. After
that the agent id is the only handle: `hub send`, `agent://<id>`, `history://<id>`.


8. A child stays reachable after it yields
-------------------------------------------
Yielding moves a child to idle, and later to parked, but a `hub send` wakes it with
its context intact. That is how discussants and mentors do multiple rounds. Spawning a
fresh one to continue the same topic throws away everything it read and pays for it
again.


9. Plan mode silently rewrites the child
-----------------------------------------
While the parent is in plan mode, children are wrapped read-only: tools cut to
read/grep/glob/web_search, spawns cleared, prewalk cleared. When debugging a spawn
problem, confirm you are not in plan mode first, or you are measuring the wrapper
rather than the agent definition.


10. Editing an agent file needs no restart
-------------------------------------------
Settings are reloaded and agents rediscovered before each dispatch, so an edit here
takes effect on the next spawn. Already-running children keep the prompt they started
with; there is no hot reload for a live agent.


11. Names are case-sensitive and first-wins
--------------------------------------------
Project `.omp/agents` overrides user `~/.omp/agent/agents`, custom overrides bundled,
and within one directory files are read in lexicographic filename order with duplicate
names dropped. `Task` and `task` are two different agents.


12. One broken definition does not take the others down
--------------------------------------------------------
A frontmatter failure in a custom agent file is logged as a warning and the file is
skipped. Only bundled parsing is fatal. So a file you broke presents as "that agent
mysteriously does not exist" rather than as a parse error — check ~/.omp/logs for the
warning instead of expecting a failure at the call site.


13. Do not leave a non-agent .md in this directory
---------------------------------------------------
Every .md here is parsed as an agent-definition candidate. A plain note produces, on
every discovery pass:

    warn "Failed to read agent file"
    AgentParsingError: Failed to parse agent: Invalid agent field: .../<file>.md

Observed twice per single spawn. Harmless per item 12, but it is permanent log noise
on every dispatch. Keep notes as .txt — non-markdown files are never scanned.
